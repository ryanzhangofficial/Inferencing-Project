# MESS+ â€” Energy-Optimal LLM Inference ðŸ”‹ðŸ¤–

NeurIPS 2024 AFM workshop project that routes each request to the cheapest LLM that still meets a user-defined service-level guarantee (accuracy â‰¥ $\alpha$).

## Key Contributions

- **Adaptive model selection**: Predicts performance (accuracy, latency) per query using lightweight FastText.
- **Energy minimization**: Solves a mixed-integer program to choose the most energy-efficient model under SLAs.
- **Operational support**: Handles batch inference, power monitoring (Jetson/x86), and reproducible notebooks.
